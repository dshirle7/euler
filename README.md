Project Euler Package

In celebration of Pi Day 2019, I've uploaded solutions to the first several
Project Euler challenges. This is all my own original work. The purpose was to
create solutions that exemplify object-oriented programming, emphasize
readability and reporducibility, and show consideration of performance/speed.

euler.py is a module containing all functions I wrote.

Each other module, when run, produces a printout of the solution to
the challenge it shares a number with. E.g. euler001 gives the solution to
Project Euler Problem 1.
